This project is a Windows Form application that emulates the classic Snakes and Ladders board game.
Players interact with a dynamic and visually appealing interface, taking turns to roll virtual dice
and navigate their tokens across a 36-block game board. The application features distinct classes for
Board, Token, and Player, each designed according to specific interfaces. Users can input player names,
roll dice, and observe token movements, with special events triggering informative messages on the
interface.
